# Equity and Efficiency in Municipal Service Delivery  
## Evidence from the 311 System in Chicago

**PPHA 30538 – Data Analytics and Visualization for Public Policy**  
Final Project – March 2026  
María Manjarrez & Julio Pacher

## Project Overview

Chicago exhibits substantial variation in median household income across neighborhoods. At the same time, municipal service delivery — such as pothole repair, rodent complaints, and abandoned vehicle removal — may also vary across space.

Using 311 Service Request data from the City of Chicago and neighborhood-level income data from the American Community Survey (ACS), this project examines whether:

- Service demand differs systematically across income groups  
- Service types vary by neighborhood income level  
- Response times are associated with median household income  

The analysis focuses on Chicago Community Areas and evaluates both service demand (volume) and service efficiency (completion time).

## Research Question

> Are neighborhood income differences in Chicago associated with disparities in 311 service demand and response times across Community Areas?

## Data Sources

### 1. Chicago 311 Service Requests (CHI311)
Source: City of Chicago Data Portal  

- Universe of non-emergency municipal service requests  
- Includes request type, location, submission date, and completion date  
- Used to measure:
  - Service demand (requests per 1,000 residents)
  - Service efficiency (response time in days)

### 2. American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates (2019–2023)
Source: U.S. Census Bureau  

- Median household income at the Community Area level  
- Used to classify neighborhoods into income quartiles  

---

## Sample Construction & Data Processing

- Filtered 311 service requests from **January 1, 2023 – December 31, 2024**
- Selected key variables:
  - Creation date  
  - Completion date  
  - Service type  
  - Status  
  - Community Area  

- Constructed:
  - **Response Time (days)** = Completion Date − Creation Date  
  - Total request volume per Community Area  
  - Requests per 1,000 residents  

- Merged 311 data with ACS median household income  
- Grouped Community Areas into **income quartiles (Low → High income)**
